# Imei-UI
A User Interface that allows users to view and verify their IMEI as well as request a blacklist.
This is the front end part of a larger project that is the first step in helping mobile phone users safely
view their IEMI as well as request a full phone report .

The main aim of this project is to help mobile phone users in Kenya smoothly participate in the blacklist process
with their network providers and the Communication Authority of Kenya 

Automating this process reduces the task of having ot wait for months to have your device blacklisted.
